# Paper Reading Notes (Claim-Oriented)

## Paper Information
- **Title**:  
- **Authors**:  
- **Venue / Year**:  
- **Research Area**:  
- **Paper Type**: ☐ Method ☐ Theory ☐ Empirical ☐ System ☐ Survey

---

## 🎯 Central Claim (One-Sentence, Mandatory)

> **If I can only cite this paper once, what exact statement am I citing it for?**

- **Claim Statement**:  
  > *This paper claims that …*

- **Claim Type** (choose ONE):
  - ☐ Method superiority  
  - ☐ Conceptual reframing  
  - ☐ Theoretical guarantee  
  - ☐ Empirical finding  
  - ☐ Diagnostic / negative result  

- **Claim Scope**:
  - **Applies to**: (task / data / setting)
  - **Assumes**: (key assumptions)
  - **Does NOT claim**: (explicit non-claims)

⚠️ **Rule**:  
- One sentence only  
- No “and / as well as”  
- Must be falsifiable

## 🧠 Abstract-Only Claim Extraction (Fast Pass)

> Filled **before** reading the full paper

- **Action** (What did they do?):  
- **Comparison** (Better than what?):  
- **Outcome** (What should I believe?):  
- **Conditions** (When / where does this hold?):  

> **Draft Claim from Abstract**:  
> By doing ___, this paper shows that ___ leads to ___ compared to ___ under ___.

(Revise later if needed)

---

## R — Research Question (Claim Premises)

> What must be true for the central claim to matter?

- **Problem Setting**:  
- **Previous Gap**:  
  - What existing methods fail to address?
  - Why does this gap block the claim?
- **Formal Objective (if applicable)**:  
  - $$\min_\theta \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x), y)$$
- **Why This Problem Enables the Claim**:  
  (Why solving this problem makes the claim meaningful)

---

## I — Insight (Claim Causality)

> Why *should* the central claim be true?

- **Core Insight**:  
  (Mechanism-level intuition)
- **Why This Insight Was Non-Obvious**:  
- **How It Directly Supports the Claim**:  
- **Contrast with Prior Work**:  
  (What intuition they missed)

---

## C — Contributions (Claim Decomposition)

> Which parts of the paper support which parts of the claim?

1. **Primary Contribution** (Directly supports central claim)  
2. **Secondary Contributions** (Support scope / robustness)  
3. **Auxiliary Contributions** (Nice-to-have, not core)

⚠️ Mark clearly:
- ☐ Claim-critical  
- ☐ Claim-supporting  
- ☐ Claim-irrelevant (for citation)

---

## H — How It Works (Claim Realization)

> How is the claim operationalized?

### Problem Formulation
- Objective:
  $$\min_\theta \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x), y)$$
- Key assumptions that the claim depends on:

### Algorithm Overview
- Step 1:  
- Step 2:  
- Step 3:  

- **Key Innovation Step** (Claim hinge point):  
- **What would break the claim if removed?**

### Complexity & Practicality
- Time:
- Space:
- Deployment constraints relevant to claim:

---

## 🔬 Experiments & Results (Claim Evidence)

> Do the experiments actually justify the claim?

### Evidence Table

| Evidence | Supports Which Claim Part | Strength |
|--------|--------------------------|----------|
| Main results | Core claim | Strong / Medium / Weak |
| Ablation | Causal mechanism | Medium |
| Theory | Boundary condition | Conditional |
| Case study | Intuition only | Weak |

### Stress Tests
- Where does the claim weaken?
- Any untested assumptions?

---

## 🔍 Claim–Evidence Sanity Check (Required)

- Is the **central claim directly tested**? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
- Is support **empirical / theoretical / mixed**?  
- Any overreach in wording vs evidence?

> **If reviewer #2 questioned the claim, what is the weakest link?**

---

## 🔑 Final Claim (Post-Reading, Canonical)

> **Final version of the one-sentence claim** (this is what you will actually cite):

> *This paper shows that …*

(If this differs from the abstract version, note why.)

---

## 🧾 Citation-Ready Summary (Optional but Powerful)

> **One sentence I can paste into a literature review**:

> “Author et al. (Year) show that …”

---

## ✍️ Writing & Reviewing Takeaways (Optional)

### Claim Framing
- How is confidence calibrated?
- Any effective hedging language?

### Experimental Storytelling
- Which experiment answers which doubt about the claim?

### Transfer to My Work
- Can my paper support a claim this clean?
- Which section of mine is currently claim-weak?
