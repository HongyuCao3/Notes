     - check whether the simplified dataset has the same ditribution as the whole dataset, <font color=red> affect method & experiment design </font>
 - Baseline
   - most baseline & analysis for dataset in data-centric research can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
     - learn coding techniques
     - always in jupyter notebooks
   - <u>find baseline before design method, which can provides insights</u>
