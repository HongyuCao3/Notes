## Introduction
 - identify the research map and current gap, locate our method and perspective
 - every new concept should have its context
 - technical points should be attached coherently with application
 - use easy to understand words and examples


## Method
 - split the model structure and workflow to different illustrations
 - equation should almost fill the line, combine short equations
 - use the same color for the same concept

## Experiments
 - main experiment should prove the main point of paper (eg. the robustness of the model)
 - images contains more information, combine different types of images
 - only state key change in tables, add scientific guess

## Conclusion
 - add limitation
