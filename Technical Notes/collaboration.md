# Collaborative Research Workflow Template

This template outlines the collaboration structure among **advisor**, **senior researcher**, and **junior researcher** within a research project. It is designed to ensure clear task division, efficient progress, and intellectual growth at all levels.

---

## 1. Roles and Responsibilities

### **Advisor**
- Acts as the **strategic advisor** of the project.
- Defines the **research direction** and validates whether a specific topic or idea aligns with the overarching research agenda.
- Provides **conceptual judgment** on the scientific motivation, novelty, and positioning.
- Offers **high-level feedback** on the soundness and completeness of experimental results.
- Participates in the final **draft polishing** and provides feedback on clarity, logic, and contribution framing.

### **Senior Researcher**
- Acts as the **technical mentor and domain expert**.
- Refines the **task definition** within a given topic, leveraging prior experience or related publications.
- Evaluates the **feasibility and complexity** of proposed methods.
- Guides **method design** and **metric selection** to ensure methodological soundness.
- Reviews **experimental setup and results** for alignment with motivation and task objectives.
- Assists in **draft revision and technical refinement**.

### **Junior Researcher**
- Plays the role of **idea initiator and implementer**.
- Conducts **literature review** and formulates the **initial high-level idea**, explaining the motivation and related works.
- Designs **methodology** and **evaluation metrics** under guidance.
- Implements the **experimental pipeline**, including baseline selection, code development, and ablation studies.
- Summarizes **experimental findings** and drafts the **initial manuscript**.
- Learns to **present and defend** their idea logically and academically.

## 2. Collaboration Stages

| Stage | Primary Contributor | Main Objective | Advisor’s Role | Senior Researcher’s Role |
|:------|:--------------------|:----------------|:----------------|:--------------------------|
| **1. Topic Definition** | Advisor | Identify key research question or problem direction | Define topic scope | Provide related sub-tasks or contexts |
| **2. Task Refinement** | Senior | Formulate precise task definition and dataset/problem setting | Approve research relevance | Refine problem statement |
| **3. Idea Formation** | Junior | Propose high-level idea with motivation and related work | Assess scientific motivation | Evaluate idea novelty and reasonableness |
| **4. Method & Metric Design** | Junior + Senior | Design method, model structure, and evaluation metrics | Ensure conceptual alignment | Assess feasibility and complexity |
| **5. Experiment Design & Implementation** | Junior | Execute experiments, choose baselines, and analyze results | Evaluate completeness | Supervise experiment execution and result interpretation |
| **6. Draft Preparation** | Junior | Write initial manuscript | Provide high-level feedback | Revise and polish technical details |
| **7. Final Review & Submission** | All | Refine writing, visualization, and contribution statement | Final approval | Technical proofreading |

## 3. Communication Guidelines
- **Regular meetings:** Weekly or bi-weekly discussions to report progress and get feedback.
- **Documentation:** Maintain shared documents (e.g., idea logs, experiment reports, result summaries).
- **Feedback cycle:**  
  1. Junior → prepares report/slides.  
  2. Senior → gives technical and feasibility feedback.  
  3. Advisor → gives strategic and conceptual feedback.

## 4. Educational Value
- Juniors learn **how to formulate research questions and methods**.
- Seniors gain experience in **mentorship and project management**.
- Advisors focus on **strategic direction and research quality control**.

## 5. Summary
This collaborative structure aims to ensure:
- Efficient division of labor.
- Clear communication hierarchy.
- Iterative feedback that strengthens both research quality and participant growth.
