# New Fields Start Up

## Paper Reading
 - survey
   - build intuition
   - perpare for task selection
 - task specified papers

## Task Selection
 - choose simple tasks at first
   - clear & widely used metrics
   - well-formated datasets
   - at least 3 related papers as baselines
   - <font color=red>binary classification task $\rightarrow$ first order to choose</font>
 - find research gaps in complex tasks
   - machine learning baseline
     - classifier for classification
     - VAE, HMM  for generation
     - RL for decision-making (no clear metrics, only intuitive feedback)
   - deep learing baseline
     - pertrained model
     - LLMs few shot
